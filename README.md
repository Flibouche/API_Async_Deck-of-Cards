<img style="width:100%" src="https://github.com/Flibouche/API_Async_Deck-of-Cards/blob/main/images/deckofcards1.png">

The goal of this tutorial is to develop a web application that interacts with the "Deck of Cards" API. The application allows users to shuffle, draw, and display cards from a standard deck. This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, making API calls, and dynamically updating the DOM.

## Project Contents
- **HTML Structure**: The basic structure of the web page, including containers for buttons and card displays.
- **CSS Styling**: Styles to enhance the user interface, making the application visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for interacting with the "Deck of Cards" API, including functions for shuffling the deck, drawing cards, and updating the UI dynamically.
- **API Integration**: Using the `fetch` API to make asynchronous requests to the "Deck of Cards" API, demonstrating practical use of async/await in JavaScript.

## Features
- **Shuffle Deck**: Allows users to shuffle the deck, ensuring a randomized order of cards.
- **Draw Card**: Users can draw a card from the deck, which will then be displayed on the screen.
- **Reset Deck**: Resets the deck and reshuffles it, starting fresh with a new randomized order.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Asynchronous requests to fetch the informations of the "Deck of Cards" API
